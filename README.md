# Trendyol-Seller-Product-List

This code is written for to list all the products a sellers have them in his/her listings.
It requires you to insert an unique seller id which is provided by Trendyol to all the sellers.
After that, the code handles the rest.
First it will calculate how many pages there are.
Then, it will search each page to show you all the products' links.

Further development is in progress...
